The ``info.yaml`` file
======================

At the heart of papis there is the information file.  The info file contains
all information about the documents.

It uses the `yaml <http://www.yaml.org/start.html>`_ syntax to store
information, which is a very human readable language. It is quite format free,
`papis` does not assume that any special information should be there.

If you are storing papers with papis, then you most probably would like to
store author and title in there,
